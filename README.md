## Inspiration
We were inspired to build from our team's individual experience and background to work on a beginner's project that could leverage communication systems towards social good impact.  

## What it does
Our chatbot helps users find a charity that best fits their needs and wants. We understand that donating money can be a tricky venture to navigate, and our chatbot is aimed towards creating custom recommendations for users of diverse backgrounds and interests. 

## How we built it
We built the chatbot using Twilio and Python, and developed the framework locally, with room for a scalable deployment somewhere in a cloud. We collaborated on debugging the Python script as well as the Twilio installation using Google Docs, Google Colaboratory, Visual Studio Code and Zoom. 

## Challenges we ran into
Our primary challenge was developing the Python script and debugging the script as well so that the user received the correct response. We ran into a limited understanding of TwiML (markup language for Twilio). 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to create a chatbot! This is also our first hackathon for two of the three teammates! 

## What we learned
We learned how to run a Python script for Twilio, how to send free text messages, how to debug the TwiML script, how to create a ranking - recommendation system from a Kaggle dataset using a Pandas dataframe. 

## What's next for Charity Chatbot
We are seeking to build out the Python script so that it may provide users the most customized recommendation on transparent and effective charities. Charity Chatbot is also headed to the cloud! We hope to leverage Google Cloud to help deploy our chatbot.
